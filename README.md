## How do I approach designing software?

>Working OpenGL tested my skills quite a bit, but I feel as if I came out on the other side with a new found respect for graphical visualization. I learned a lot as I went through this course, which led me to follow the tutorials and processes that were already in place pretty closely. My initial thought process was to complete all of the difficult tasks first so once I got those out of the way, I could have a strong finish and complete the project. There are many different methods to approaching projects such as this, but I feel that if I were to follow this process in future projects of completing the difficult stuff first, it will lead me to success.

## How do I approach developing programs?

>Whether it's during code development or other aspects of my life, I tend to operate by trial and error. Finding what works and what doesn't work not only allows me to have a desired outcome, but it also teaches me how to move forward with similar opportunities because I already have the experience. Something new that I don't typically do with programming that I did, was to slow down. Often times, throwing things at the wall to see what sticks doesn't always work, and it was obivious in this project. Throughout the milestones I became more and more comfortable with the material and was able to pin down why something wasn't working, which was very useful and I did not have to chase bugs too often.


## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

>Computational graphics and visualization provided me with a lot of knowledge on what it means to see under the hood of how things are created, which thoughout this course was 3D objects. Having the ability to view the inner-workings of 3D objects gave me insight on how simple yet complicated certain coding aspects can be. Going forward in my education career, I think I will be able to benefit from this course as it showed me how to problem solve more efficiently. As far as my professional career, I currently work in the IT field but plan to change to either into the engineering field, or even the security field, so I don't see how it would tie in, but you never know!
