## How do I approach designing software?

> Working OpenGL tested my skills quite a bit, but I feel as if I came out on the other side with a new found respect for graphical visualization. I learned a lot as I went through this course, which led me to follow the tutorials and processes that were already in place pretty closely. My initial thought process was to complete all of the difficult tasks first so once I got those out of the way, I could have a strong finish and complete the project. There are many different methods to approaching projects such as this, but I feel that if I were to follow this process in future projects of completing the difficult stuff first, it will lead me to success.

## How do I approach developing programs?

>Whether it's during code development or other aspects of my life, I tend to operate by trial and error. Finding what works and what doesn't work not only allows me to have a desired outcome, but it also teaches me how to move forward with similar opportunities because I already have the experience. Something new that I don't typically do with programming that I did, was to slow down. Often times, throwing things at the wall to see what sticks doesn't always work, and it was obivious in this project. Throughout the milestones I became more and more comfortable with the material and was able to pin down why something wasn't working, which was very useful and I did not have to chase bugs too often.
